# About This Site

## Why This Site?

1. When I started to learn Object Pascal with [Free Pascal](https://www.freepascal.org) and [Lazarus IDE](https://www.lazarus-ide.org), I found the wikis informative, but difficult to follow due to my English as second language.
2. There are scattered gems on Free Pascal (and Lazarus) out there I'd like to put in one bucket for quick retrieval.
3. Documenting stuff is theraputic, isn't it?

Hence, this site.

I'm compiling resources relating to [Free Pascal](https://www.freepascal.org) and [Lazarus IDE](https://www.lazarus-ide.org), for my study. Also, I'm hoping others would find these collections useful too.

I've taken care to acknowledge the original location of information & authors whenever possible. If I overlooked anyone, please inform me.

Thanks for reading.
